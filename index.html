        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Zakaria WildAli, As a junior developer, I am currently honing my skills in computer systems engineering, with a primary focus on Front-End development. While I have gained proficiency in technologies such as Java, I am eager to broaden my expertise and delve into the Back-End realm. My knowledge extends to Back-End technologies like MY-SQL, PL-SQL, and data structures, and I am excited about the prospect of gaining more hands-on experience in this area. Strengthening my Back-End skills will not only complement my existing Front-End capabilities but also allow me to contribute more effectively to comprehensive and well-integrated software solutions.
            I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with experienced Back-End developers, participate in meaningful projects, and further develop my skills as a well-rounded junior developer. Through this journey, I am confident that I can enhance my abilities and make valuable contributions to the ever-evolving field of software development.

                <h3>Travel Planning App</h3>
                <p>Developed a dynamic travel planning app that enables users to input a location, travel dates, and hotel name to retrieve weather forecasts, location coordinates, relevant images, and location data (capital, population). The system integrates with multiple APIs (Geonames, Weatherbit, Pixabay, Restcountries) to provide real-time data, with features like local storage, trip sorting by start date, expired trip highlighting, and the ability to print or export trips (individually or in bulk) to PDF. Built using Express server and Webpack.</p>

                <h3>Movie Site</h3>
                <p>An online movie guide that displays the newest movies, some details
                    about them, and a link to watch them. I used The Movie Database
                    (TMDB) API for the data, and the website was built using React with
                    Redux technology.
